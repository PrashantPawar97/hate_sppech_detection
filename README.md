# hate_sppech_detection
I used Python with Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn to classify tweets into categories like hate speech and offensive language. I preprocessed the data with tokenization and stemming, used Count Vectorizer for feature extraction, and built a decision tree model. I evaluated its performance and visualized data with Seaborn.
